\item Unstructured or block-structured mesh adaptation

\item Efficiency and accuracy

\item Adaptation criteria and adaptation frequency

\item Mapping under adaptation, compromise between:

    \item Efficiency
    \item Balance
    \item Conservation
\end{list2m}\end{minipage}

\item Ever more parallelisable algorithms

\item Co-located or staggered variables?
