Mesh refinement criteria
\end{center}

\begin{list0}

\item Climate models do not converge with resolution -- instead more features are resolved.

\item So mathematical error estimates may not be optimal refinement criteria

\item Infrequent adaptation:

\begin{list1}

\item Reduce inevitable cost and loss of accuracy associated with adaptation

\item Do not recursively resolve spurious features

\item Do not resolve all fine scales

\end{list1}
\end{list0}

Required mesh density for the next 12 hours is predicted by simulating the next 12 hours on a coarse mesh and accumulating mesh refinement metrics:
