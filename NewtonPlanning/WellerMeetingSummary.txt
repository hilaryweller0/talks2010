New Title:
Multiscale Numerics for the Atmosphere and Ocean

First Priority: paragraph for INI

Outcome:
Evaluation of different numerics for atmosphere and ocean

We will seek additional funding from:
NCAS and Grantham for workshops
HPC vendors
DOE, NFS and ONR to sponsor travel of US participants
Met Office to sponsor attendance of Met Office employees and possibly those working on dynamical core project
NERC to sponsor those working on dynamical core project (newly added)
ECMWF?

Workshops: 4 or 5 talks per day
make links with ICFD
1. Numerics
    - discretisation
    - discretisation at changes in resolution
    - conservation and balance at changes in resolution
    - closures
This workshop will occur at the end of August, hopefully directly after the unstructured ocean modelling workshop after consultation with Julie

2. Adaptivity 10-14 Dec at INI
    - static
    - dynamic
    - meshing
    - refinement criteria
    - conservation and balance
    - mapping and coupling

3. Computer Science, computational science at the Met Office new dynamical core
    - to be held at the Met office after consultation with them
    - Oct-Nov
    - seek sponsorship from Microsoft research and Fujitsu

Work Plans
Bring your own model if appropriate
Test problems for us to do and compare with each other will be decided on in advance by emailing all participants
    - numerical analysis
    - static test problems with resolution changes
    - mapping problems

Training course
This should be for post-docs rather than for graduate students
Climate for mathematicians and maths for climate scientists
How and why climate models work
Timing and lecturers for this were not discussed
There would be time right at the end, after the final workshop? Sounds unpopular

Email strategy:
Email everyone at the same time asking for an interest in attending
forward responses to Christine West
ask for tentative commitment for one month

First Round of Invitees:
Possible Roschild fellow: Max Gunzburger
